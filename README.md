My first alpha release (0.1.0 alpha), that Im publishing on github.

# A quick run down:
 
- Its writen in C++
- Modularity first (I am refactoring the code rn so 90% xd)
- Savegame, termios, text rendered


# Key features:
 
- A dedicated (self created) save game lib
- A bare bones map system
- Fully working menus
- A bare bones shop
- An inventory


# Missing:
 
- Level system
- Fighting system
- Quests and the rp chunk of the game
- Scrolling maps (like in the 1986 The legend of Zelda)
- Skill tree for the different classes
- Creativity for the story, items and monsters to fight


# Known bugs:
 
- On MacOS, if you enter you name in the player creation menu, the top part of the border doubles for whatever reason


Its was kinda hard to code it but im proud. The first project where I dedicated more than 20 hours into.
Its a passion project, that I wanted to make with my best friend 5 years ago (where I was 13) and lost interest. But now here to finish it :D
