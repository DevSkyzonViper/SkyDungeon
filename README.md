My first alpha release (0.1.0 alpha), that Im publishing on github.
A bit of a side story first.

It was 5 years ago (when I was 13) and I was scripting in batch, where I got the idea to create a terminal based RPG game.
My friend loved the idea, and wanted to help with the design, in the sense of creativity, art, items and so. After a while
he didnt want to continue, and a week after I stopped too.

And now here we are, on the 3rd try to do it. From Batch -> C -> C++



# A quick run down:
 
- Its writen in C++
- Modularity first (I am refactoring the code rn so 50% xd)
- Savegame, termios, text rendered



## Key features:
 
- Deedicated core functions
- A bare bones map system
- Scrolling maps system
- Fully working menus
- A bare bones shop
- A bare bones inventory



## Missing:
 
- Level system
- Fighting system
- Quests and the rp chunk of the game
- Skill tree for the different classes
- Creativity for the story, items and monsters to fight



## Known bugs:
 
- Currently there are none
- Windows is untested



Its was kinda hard to code it but im proud. The first project where I dedicated more than 35 hours into.
Its a passion project, that I wanted to make with my best friend 5 years ago (where I was 13) and lost interest. But now
here to finish it :D
